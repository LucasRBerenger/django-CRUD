# Django CRUD System

## Project Overview

This project is a **CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete)** application built using the Django framework. It serves as a basic demonstration of Django's capabilities in managing database-driven web applications. Users can add, view, update, and delete records through a user-friendly interface. The application is designed to be extensible, making it an excellent starting point for more complex projects. Thanks for 'Tech With Tim' class about this project.
